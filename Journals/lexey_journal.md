Today, I worked on:

* Setting up the tables for an employee user

I was able to set up the sables with a foreign key relation 
to the accounts model. Which will later hopefully accomplish the 
ability to be able to let the user edit their profile to represent 
themselves.

Not sure how to set up the ability to add a profile picture, and how 
it would be stored in the database, but something I have researched 
a little bit. Another thing later on I'll add is the connection to 
user feedback.
