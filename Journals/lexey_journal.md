## December 1, 2022

Today, I worked on:

* Employer info

I created create, update, and get by id endpoints for user info. Going to 
refactor with chris tomorrow to grab the data better, so it'll be easier 
to grab on the front end.

Today, I worked on:

* Employee info, React

Added get by id endpoint and query for employee info. Aki was able to 
help me solve why my react wasn't working on my computer. Mostly had to 
do with file structure and where things where downloaded.

Today, I worked on:

* React

Watched react videos to refreash on front end. react is having issues 
with auto reload on my computer. While trying to fix it, files were 
mixed up and everyones project was working differently. Trying to 
solve why it's not working on my computer even though I cloned the 
most up to date repo to try and see if react works. That same repo 
works on other team members computers who have windows.

Today, I worked on:

* Figured out employee info queries and started setting up front-end

Finally figure out how to connect the employee information to the id 
of the logged in account. Now working with Chris, Aki, and Curtis to set 
up the react app so we can get started on the front-end.

Today, I worked on:

* Trouble shooting the employee info queries

Still trouble shooting but I feel like I'm figuring it out and getting 
closer. Tried a lot of different approaches, and nothing has fully 
worked so far, but I am using what I have learned from the different 
approaches to narrow down what I am missing in my code to get it to work. 
Messing around with these approaches has helped me get more comfortable 
with understanding and writing sql statements.

Today, I worked on:

* Trouble shooting the employee info queries

The routers are set up, but still having trouble with the queries.
Spent a some time researching and finding a lot of good resources 
to bookmark for later, as well as some good direction for how I can 
get the queries to work.



## November 22, 2022

Today, I worked on:

* Creating endpoints for the user info section

Started setting up the queries and routers for employee info.
Created the files and figured out the wireframing for what 
information we want to be shown on the profile.



## November 21, 2022

Today, I worked on:

* Setting up the tables for an employee user

I was able to set up the sables with a foreign key relation 
to the accounts model. Which will later hopefully accomplish the 
ability to be able to let the user edit their profile to represent 
themselves.

Not sure how to set up the ability to add a profile picture, and how 
it would be stored in the database, but something I have researched 
a little bit. Another thing later on I'll add is the connection to 
user feedback.
