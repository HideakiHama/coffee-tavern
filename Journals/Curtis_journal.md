Tasked with looking up ways to upload files on Fast API
Found way to request file. Not sure if its the same thing but will use for now.
Watched a bunch of youtube videos on requesting files.
Found this video to be most helpful https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bpBkwFdc8&ab_channel=FastAPIChannel

Finished with the upload resume file post request.
Was able to test the feature on the localhost:8000/docs
gave a good ol' 200 code!
Will be working solo on the get request part of it
Also pushed my main.py and new uploadresume.py
